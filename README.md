# bt-target
## This is broken right now, don't use it, a fix is being worked on!

This repository was originally a fork and now it's own repository as it's a slightly changed qtarget but still named bt-target, most of the code comes from qtarget as I find their work awesome on this and what they've achieved with it, mostly the optimization.

This version is for QBCore and ESX but can be used by any framework but you will have to make your own changes then.

The readme and wiki are a work in progress as I'm now on vacation and I can't do much, I am pushing updates from qtarget and bt-target into this if applicable just to keep it updated.

You are free to help through Pull Requests, I love some help!
