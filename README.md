# bt-target

This repository was originally a fork and now it's own repository as it's a slight mix and change of qtarget and bt-target at once, most of the code comes from qtarget and some of the javascript and some functions are from bt-target.

This version is for QBCore and ESX.

The readme and wiki are a work in progress as I'm now on vacation and I can't do much, I am pushing updates from qtarget and bt-target into this if applicable just to keep it updated.

It is not advised to use this yet but if you want to test it for me and report what's not working through issues or helping via Pull Requests, feel free to, I love some help!
